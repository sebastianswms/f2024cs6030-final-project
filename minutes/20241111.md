    1. Riley will work on PID and PPC.
    2. Garrett will work on object detection and stopping movement.
    3. Alice will work on finalizing waypoint generation.
    4. Sebastian will faciliate and integrate other team members' contributions.
       1. Combine speed-PID and steering-PID into a comprehensive structure.
       2. Implement pausing movement based on published object detection messages.
